4. Recommended Study Flow





Setup (once)





Bookmark Content Directory.  



Download or clone AZ500-AzureSecurityTechnologies for lab files.  



Open AZ-500 study guide and skim skills measured.  



Ensure you have an Azure subscription (e.g. free account).



Per module (in order)





Open the lab from the hosted content directory.  



Do the lab in the Azure portal (use repo files when the lab asks for templates/scripts).  



Align with the “Skills measured” section of the study guide.  



Optionally keep a simple tracker (e.g. markdown) with lab name and date completed.



Before the exam





Revisit identity/access, network security, Key Vault, Defender for Cloud, and Sentinel.  



Take the free practice assessment and any Microsoft Learn practice tests.  



Review weak areas using the study guide.



5. Optional: Local Materials (This Repo or New Folder)

You are currently in the AZ-104 repo. For AZ-500 you can:





Option A: Add a single AZ-500_PREPARATION_PLAN.md in this repo that contains this plan and the lab table (with correct URLs) so you have one place for both AZ-104 and AZ-500.  



Option B: Clone AZ500-AzureSecurityTechnologies into a separate folder and add AZ-500_PREPARATION_PLAN.md (and optionally a short STUDY_TRACKER.md) there.

No code or existing AZ-104 files need to change for Option A; only one new file is added.



6. Key Resources





Hosted labs: microsoftlearning.github.io/AZ500-AzureSecurityTechnologies  



Study guide: AZ-500 study guide  



Certification: Azure Security Engineer Associate  



Learning path: Manage security operations (Microsoft Learn)

7. Summary Checklist





Use the hosted content directory as the main entry for lab instructions.  



Use plain underscores in any AZ-500 lab URLs you write (e.g. LAB_01_RBAC.html), not %5F.  



Complete all 11 labs in order, aligned with exam domains.  



Use the official study guide and practice assessment before the exam.  



Optionally add AZ-500_PREPARATION_PLAN.md (and tracker) in this repo or in a cloned AZ-500 repo.
